# Internship_PoncerLab
Pipeline for project on investigating Task-3 channel openers in human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy

Files for MEA recording analysis:
parameters_file.py: Python file that contains all the meta parameters used in my analysis 
MEA_functions.py: Python file that contains all the functions that I developed for analysing MEA recordings (h5 files with extracellular recordings from microelectrode arrays)
pipeline_report_task3.ipynb: Jupyter notebook where I applied this developped tools for a specific project measuring the effect of 2 molecules on two types of activity (MUA, IILDs) in postoperative mTLE tissue

Files for patch recording analysis: 
patch_analysis.py: Python file that groups both my parameters and my functions for analysing patch recording (voltage- and current-clamp) 
patch_pipeline.ipynb: Jupyter notebook where I applied this tools to characterize the effect of a molecule on the intracellular properties of human dentate granule cells in epileptic hippocampi
